## Overview Of The Project
The hierarchical method is a grouping technique to form a hierarchy or based on a certain level so that it resembles a tree structure. Thus the grouping process is carried out in stages or stages. In the hierarchical method, there are two types of grouping strategies, namely agglomerative and divisive. Agglomerative (merging method) is a hierarchical grouping strategy that starts with each object in a separate cluster and then forms a growing cluster. So, the number of initial clusters is equal to the number of objects. In the agglomerative method, the best known grouping techniques are Single linkage, Average linkage, and Complete linkage. In this project, I apply agglomerative Single Linkage and Average Linkage techniques. The dataset used is a random dataset which will be divided into 4.
